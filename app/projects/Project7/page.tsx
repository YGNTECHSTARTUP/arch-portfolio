      title="The Crumpled Canopy:  Translating Ephemeral Form"
      mainDescription="This project translates the transient gesture of crumpling paper into an enduring architectural structure. The methodology involved decoding the paper's chaotic wrinkles into a rational system of polyhedral facets and linear struts. The result is a structure defined by Tectonic Fragmentation, where the vibrant, faceted skin acts as both a visual mosaic and the structural system. Functionally, the pavilion is a Programmable Threshold, creating a dynamic, semi-open public space that actively frames the landscape and serves as a flexible venue for community gathering."
